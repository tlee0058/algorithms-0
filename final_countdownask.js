/*The Final Countdown
This is based on “Flexible Countdown”. The parameter names are not as helpful, 
but the problem is essentially identical; don’t be thrown off! 
Given 4 parameters (param1,param2,param3,param4), print the multiples of param1, 
starting at param2 and extending to param3. One exception: if a multiple is equal to param4, 
then skip (don’t print) that one. Do this using a WHILE loop.

Example: Given (3,5,17,9), print 6,12,15 (which are all of the multiples of 3 between 5 and 17, 
    except for the value 9).*/

function final_countdown(param1, param2, param3, param4){
    var i = param2;
    while (i < param3){
        if(i % param1 === 0 && i !== param4){
            console.log(i);
        }
        i++;
    }
}
final_countdown(3,5,17,9);
